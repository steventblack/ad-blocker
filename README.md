# ad-blocker

A simple ad-blocker for Synology devices

## Background

The main goal of this project is to setup a simple ad-blocking service that will work on all LAN-connected devices. In order to keep things simple, an additional goal is to run this service on the Synology NAS that already provides many file and network services (including DNS) for the LAN. Because the DNS service is in active use on the Synology device, many solutions (like the very nice Pi-hole package) are not workable as there are conflicts over the DNS port. This solution has a minimal impact on the standard Synology system and so should be largely free of unwanted side effects and be "update friendly".

There are several advantages of enabling a LAN-wide ad-blocking service over traditional browser plugins:

* It's easier to maintain than ensuring all browsers have the appropriate plugins and remain updated on all devices
* It works for mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc.) for both browser and apps
* It is effective even on devices not allowed to be modified, e.g. school-owned tablets

## Requirements

This project requires some familiarity with the basic Unix system and tools. Additionally, access to the Synology admin interface is requried. This project _does_ involve access to the internals to your system. As such, there is always the risk of an accident or mistake leading to irrecoverable data loss. **Be mindful when logged onto your system -- especially when performing any action as root or admin.**

This project should be completed in 30-60 minutes.

This service requires the following skills:

* Editing files on a Unix system (e.g. `vi`, `nano`)
* Setting up a DNS zone via the web-based DSM interface
* SSH access
* Standard Unix tools (`sudo`, `chown`, `chmod`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `wget`, `cat`, etc.)
* Administration/root access to the Synology device

These instructions have been verified as working on a Synology DS1513+ running DSM 6.1-15047 Update 2.

## DNS Service Setup

1. Log in as adminstrator to the Synology DSM (administration interface)
1. In the Package Center, open the "DNS Server" app.
1. Select the "Zones" tab and create a new Master Zone.
1. Fill in the following fields as follows:
    * Domain Type: Forward Zone
    * Domain Name: `null.zone.file`
    * Master DNS Server: `<IP Address of your Synology Device>`
    * Serial Format: Date (YYYYMMDDNN)
1. Enable "Limit zone update" but do __not__ set any values for it.
1. (Optional) Set a limit on the Zone Transfer rules to restrict it to your LAN.
1. (Optional) Set a limit on the source IP rules to restrict it to your LAN.

The Domain Name _must_ be `null.zone.file` and the Serial Format _must_ be set as `Date` as that is what the updater script requires. The blocked zones must reference a static zone configuration file and so the "Limit zone update" must be enabled with no values so that the resulting configuration file is generated with the line `allow-update {none;};`. The Master DNS Server should have the same IP address as your Synology device. (Don't fret over this; it will be overwritten later.)

## Script Installation

1. SSH as the administrator to the Synology device
    * `ssh admin@synology.example.com`
2. Run the following command

    ```bash
        sudo -i
        wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xW1sKy/ad-blocker/master/install.sh | sudo /bin/sh
    ```

The ad-blocking functionality should now be in effect. You can test the effectiveness by disabling any ad-blocking plugins in your browser and navigating to any ad-laden website to verify ads remain suppressed. Mobile devices should similarly be tested.

## Automated Block List Updating

1. Log in as administrator to the Synology DSM (administration interface)
1. Open up the "Control Panel" app.
1. Select the "Task Scheduler" service.
1. Create a new Scheduled Task for a user-defined script.
1. For the "General" tab, fill in the fields as follows:
    * Task: `Ad-blocker Update`
    * User: `root`
    * Enabled: (checked)
1. For the "Schedule" tab, fill in fields as follows:
    * Run on the following days: Daily
    * First run time: `03:20`
    * Frequency: once a day
1. For the "Task Settings" tab, fill in the fields as follow:
    * User defined script: `cd /tmp/; sudo /usr/local/bin/ad-blocker.sh`

The run time should be set to run no more than once a day and be performed at an off-peak traffic time. The block lists don't change that frequently so be courteous to the provider. It is not strictly necessary to have the run details sent via email, but enabling it may help if there's a need to troubleshoot.

## Blacklist/Whitelist

User-defined blacklist/whitelist functionality has been added to allow personalized rules to either enhance blocking or permit access. Templates for the configuration files of this functionality are automatically created upon the initial run of the `ad-blocker.sh` script.

### Blacklist

A user-defined blacklist functionality is available to add custom domains into the block list. This may help fill in any "gaps" for domains not captured by the [yoyo.org](http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/) block list. There is no harm if a domain appears in both the user-specified black list and the main list as the scripts will detect the duplicate and skip over any redundant mentions.

1. SSH as the administrator to the Synology device
    * `ssh admin@synology.example.com`
1. Navigate to the appropriate directory
    * `cd /usr/local/etc`
1. Open `ad-blocker-bl.conf` for editing
    * `sudo vi ad-blocker-bl.conf`
1. Add additional fully-qualified domains (one per line) and save the file
    * Example: `ad.example.com`
    * Comments are indicated by a `#` as the first character on a line
1. Re-run the `ad-blocker.sh` script to pick up the changes (or wait until next scheduled time)
    * `cd /usr/local/bin`
    * `sudo ./ad-blocker.sh`

### Whitelist

The user-defined whitelist allows specified domains to continue to work despite their appearance in either the Block list or the blacklist. Note that the whitelist is applied last, regardless as to the the source of the domain.

1. SSH as the administrator to the Synology device
    * `ssh admin@synology.example.com`
1. Navigate to the appropriate directory
    * `cd /usr/local/etc`
1. Open `ad-blocker-wl.conf` for editing
    * `sudo vi ad-blocker-wl.conf`
1. Add additional fully-qualified domains (one per line) and save the file
    * Example: `ad.example.com`
    * Comments are indicated by a `#` as the first character on a line
1. Re-run the `ad-blocker.sh` script to pick up the changes (or wait until next scheduled time)
    * `cd /usr/local/bin`
    * `sudo ./ad-blocker.sh`

## Caveats

This solution works well for blocking the vast majority of ad providers. It should help speed up page rendering as well as provide a degree of privacy and security to your devices. However, it is not a panacea and you should continue to practice safe browsing habits. In particular, remember that this solution only applies to devices _within_ the LAN and so mobile devices may lose any protections it offers when using a different network.

For real tho? is this the same guy or just a weird coincidence?
